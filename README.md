Welcome to my final project for Flatiron Bootcamp, a fullstack web app built with React, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. Create a user account, contribute posts to writing prompts, and favorite and reply to other users' posts!

## Overview and Features

Without being logged in, you can view all prompts and posts but cannot interact with them.

If logged in as a regular (non-admin) user, you'll be able to contribute posts to prompts, edit your own posts, and favorite and reply to posts. You'll have your own profile page where your posts and favorites will be displayed.

An admin user will have expanded privileges--editing or deleting anyone's posts, creating prompts, deleting prompts, and deleting entire accounts.
